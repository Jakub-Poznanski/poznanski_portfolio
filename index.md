Welcome to my professional portfolio! I am a physics major with an astrophysics minor graduating from UConn in may 2026. I am passionate about programming, electronics, and mechatronics.   

### About Me
I have gained hands on experience throughg internships and projects that focus on data analysis, simulating astrophysical systems, and electrical design. 
For the past year, I have been working with Dr. Cara Battersby on the Atacama Large Millimeter Array Central Molecular Zone Exploration Survey (ACES) projects.  My expertise includes:  
-python and c programming   
-electrical and mechanical design experience  
-data analysis, problem solving, and numerical simulations  
  
### My Projects
-ACES Inflow HVDCC Regions  
-traced regions of inflow within the central 500 pc of the Milky Way to determine more precise line of sight distances in the CMZ
