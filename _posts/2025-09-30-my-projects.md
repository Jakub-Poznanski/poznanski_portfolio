Project Highlights: More than just Astronomy
---------------------------------------------

During my undergraduate career, I have worked on a wide range of projects, from astronomy research to electrical engineering design.  

1. ACES Inflow HVDCC Regions  
    I co-led a team of researchers during a paper sprint, during which we created a catalog of molecular clouds travelling at a wide range of
    radial velocities and used these data to infer line of sight distance from Earth. This was an amazing learning experience for me as I have
    never worked with astronomical data or worked an a scientific paper. Co-leading the team was also great for improving my leadership skills,
    as we would have daily team meetings to delegate tasks and determine goals for the day.
2. Voice Assistant Design
   One of my side projects that I am currently working on is to design and build a voice assistant from scratch that i can use to replace an
   Amazon Alexa device using LLMs and a raspberry pi. Working on this project has been incredibly rewarding. I have learned firsthand how computer
   code is translated into machine language and how to leverage processing units to do exactly what you want.

These experiences have not only strengthened my technical skills but also given me a deeper appreciation for the collaborative nature of scientific research.
